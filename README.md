Ultra96 Bitcoin Miner
=====================

A basic miner for an Ultra96 development board. This project includes the
SystemVerilog files necessary for the project. These synthesize in Vivado, but
the project in full is not included here.

This was done for [EE382N](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~mcdermot/ee382n_spring_2022.html)
during the Spring 2022 semester.

The C drivers required for interfacing with this project will be uploaded in
a companion repository.
